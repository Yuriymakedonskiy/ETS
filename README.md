# Getting Started with Vite and React

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [React](https://reactjs.org).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for more information.

### `npm run serve`

Starts a local server to serve the production build. Use this command to test your production build locally.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
